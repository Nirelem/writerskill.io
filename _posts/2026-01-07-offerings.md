Carlo entered the stables of the farmhouse with a rush of excitement. The evening breeze made for a calm night along the grassy slopes, despite the thrill of celebrating his tenth birthday.

There stood three horses side by side, their bodies covered by the large wooden fences. Carlo always had an affinity for horses– he likely got it from his father, who used to enter horse racing competitions in his youth, and now owned horseback riding stables. They were primarily used for tourists who wanted to go horseback riding as a recreational activity.

Whenever he rode horses, Carlo always felt brave and even proud, even if it was just for a few moments. He remembered his father’s pet horse, Caramel, who had a glossy light brown coat. Her skin was covered in pink and red wounds. They would care for the horse together, until his father sent her away to one of his horseback riding stables. She was gone one day, and Carlo's father had told him that she ran away.

The horses that stood before him left him breathless. He approached the one with a black coat and a glossy black mane, then began petting its snout. Its big, glassy eyes were soft and friendly, instantly making it his favorite. It closed its eyes, pressing its snout against Carlo's palm. The cream-colored horse beside it excitedly moved its head towards the young boy to be pet as well.

Carlo chuckled, taking his time. However, the third horse just stood at the edge, looking at him with sunken eyes. It was reddish-brown, and stood taller than the rest. 

“Carlo!” his father called out, “Tita Thea wants to see you, and your spaghetti is getting cold!” 

Carlo gave the two horses one last pet, before approaching the third one. It smelled different– not like the usual stench of horse poop. It was pungent, something unfamiliar and unbearable to Carlo, causing his eyes to water. 

Just as he was about to touch its snout, the horse reached out abruptly, its neck stretching really, really long towards Carlo. He yelped and gave it a quick pat before going back inside his house.

He ate mouthfuls of his favorite steak while watching his little cousins play on the floor of the wide living room. His older relatives spoke amongst themselves in small clusters, while Tita Thea and his father sat beside him.

“So what will you name them?” Tita Thea enthusiastically asked, her face beaming.

Carlo smiled, and swallowed his spaghetti. “The black one will be Night, the white one will be Snow, and the brown one will be Tree!”

Tita Thea chuckled, “Oh, that is so–”

“Brown one?” Carlo’s father interrupted with a smile, “Carlo, I only bought you two horses. There is no brown horse.”

Carlo froze, “No, Papa! I saw a brown one. I even pet him!”

Tita Thea looked at his father, a puzzled look on her face. 

“You're a funny boy, Carlo,” his father remarked, and said no more. Carlo smiled, thinking that his father was funny as well.

When the party was over, the house was completely quiet, the sounds of crickets and the wind being the loudest things. Carlo appreciated the rural life in his family's Baguio farmhouse, which he would visit every summer. He preferred that over the bustling atmosphere of Metro Manila. 

However, that night, Carlo had a nightmare. It was dark, with Balete trees surrounding him. Their vines hung, like the hairs of an old hag. 

Carlo's eyes darted around the dark corners of the heavily wooded area. He shivered, barely feeling his own hands. The stagnant air made him scrunch his nose, the stench of rotting fruit and meat invading his senses. He wanted to leave, but did not know how to.

There was not a sound in the forest– not even crickets nor birds, or the rustling of leaves. It was just dead silence. Suddenly, something bumped against the back of his head, causing him to yelp in surprise. Hesitantly, he turned around.

At first, he thought it was a fruit. A white-colored fruit with glistening red juice. He squinted and gave a closer look. 

It was the head of a woman, impaled against a tree branch, looking at him with dead, bloodshot eyes. Pale, and almost decaying, long and sticky black hair loosely hanging.

Carlo screamed, and his dream faded away. He jolted against his bed, and felt a cold hand running against his arm. He opened his eyes, and there was nothing. Only daylight that entered his room.

Strangely however, there was a light stench in his room. The same, unfamiliar smell of Tree. Carlo wondered, is Tree this stinky? 

He left his room, turning the doorknob that was as cold as ice. Instead of the putrid smell, the pleasant aroma of coffee took over as Carlo entered the kitchen. His father, Pedro, was brewing his regular morning coffee using the old Italian moka pot. 

“Sit down, Carlo,” said his father, “There is hot chocolate for you in the table. Swiss Miss, your favorite.”

“Papa, are there ghosts in our house?” Carlo abruptly asked, taking a seat on the cushioned chair.

“No?” his father replied, “Why?”

“I had a nightmare last night,” Carlo explained, “I was in a forest. It was so dark. I saw the head of a woman on a branch. She had black hair, very long.” 

His father's eyebrows furrowed, and he tightened his grip on the moka pot.

“Go and drink your hot chocolate now. Your horses are waiting for you,” he replied.

“But Papa, are there ghosts?” 

“None. Nightmares are not real.”

Carlo, having chosen to believe his father, took sips of his hot chocolate that morning. The sweet taste calmed him down, and the green scenery outside the kitchen's glass windows gave for a peaceful sight.

Upon finishing his last sip of Swiss Miss, Carlo placed the empty mug on the kitchen sink for the house helpers to clean. 

Carlo entered the stables, but noticed something strange. There were only two horses. The third one, Tree, was gone. 

Carlo rubbed his eyes and blinked ten more times. “Tree?” he called out, “Tree, you're somewhere here, aren't you?”

He scratched his head, pacing around the stables, just to catch a glimpse of a brown horse. There was no sign of tree.

Carlo walked towards Night and Snow who stood side-by-side. “I will ride you tomorrow,” he told Snow, as he embraced the white horse by the neck. He felt Snow’s snout nuzzle his hair and chuckled. 

“It’s your turn today, Night!” Carlo told the black horse. The horse was steady, and made Carlo feel big and strong upon mounting him.

After leaving the stables, Carlo reminded himself not to go too far. His father always warned him that it was too dangerous. 

Carlo rode his way around his family’s property. He passed by trees and small farm sheds, with the sky not being too sunny or cloudy. It was a perfect day. However, Carlo couldn't take his mind off of Tree. He wondered, and swore that Tree was always there. The stinky brown horse. Thin and tall, with a long, long neck. 

After three rounds around the farm house, Carlo stopped by a pond in the garden near the stables. He climbed off his horse and sat on the grass. 

“Night,” he said, “Where is Tree?”

The horse looked at him with its gentle black eyes, before reaching its head towards the pond to take a drink. Carlo proceeded to run his hands against Night’s soft mane. 

“If only you could talk,” Carlo said.

The horse made a neighing sound, which startled Carlo for a moment. Then, he laughed. 

“You can talk. But in horse-language.”

After a number of circles around the property, Carlo returned inside the house that afternoon, a sense of wonder washing over him.

When evening fell after a few hours, Carlo found himself sitting before his father in the dining table. He waited for his dinner, as their house helper, Manang Lena prepared it. 

“It was so fun to ride Night, Papa,” Carlo remarked.

“Oh yeah?” his father replied, beaming. 

“He was so friendly. Horses are so friendly and gentle,” Carlo added.

His father's smile fell as he nodded. Why is Papa suddenly sad? Carlo wondered, puzzled by his father's change in mood since that morning. 

“Ssssshhhhh”

“Papa?” Carlo asked, “Did you make that sound?”

“What sound?” his father asked. 

Before Carlo could reply, Manang Lena arrived at the table with their dinner.

“The meat is tough again, Papa,” Carlo remarked. His father did not reply.

After leaving his dishes for Manang Lena to wash, Carlo opened the television. The daily news channel played, titled “Balita ng Gabi”.  It was a channel that always presented news surrounding the local area, and broadcasted only at night. 

The report presented a weather forecast of the succeeding days being sunny. However, on the bottom of the screen was a notice. Another disappearance of a young girl in the area.

However, this was no surprise to Carlo as much as it startled him. Disappearances were common in the local area, and this was why his father never let him leave their property. They also had some security guards. Unfazed by the news, Carlo shut the television, growing sleepy. 

That night, Carlo had another dream. It was the same dark and dense forest. It felt very familiar, almost like a memory to Carlo. The rotting smell, the unmoving air, and the freezing cold. 

Carlo wrapped his arms around himself, his breath shaking. He wanted to wake up from the frightening situation, but couldn't. The crooked trees covered the path with shadows. Carlo was unsure of whether the branches were really branches, or bodyparts. He did not want to know.

Carlo found a clearing amongst the trees, and upon entering, saw a startling sight. The tall and comforting cobblestone house surrounded by fences that he often visited was now nothing but ruins. Giant trees grew out of its grand structure, vines overtaking every corner. The fences were broken, the wooden parts decayed. The farmhouse was now a shell of what it used to be. Carlo fell to his knees, as warm tears streamed down his face.

He woke up frightened, but immediately relaxed. The arm that embraced him felt comforting, and he leaned against it.

That was until, he remembered that he was alone. Carlo suppressed a scream, as the embrace tightened around him. He struggled and struggled, and shut his eyes tightly.

When he opened them again, there was nothing that held him. Carlo hoped that it was just another nightmare.

The following morning, Carlo found his father brewing his morning coffee as always. This time, however, he had deep eyebags. It was almost like he did not sleep.

“Papa…” Carlo said, “You know, I had another nightmare last night.”

“Again...?” his father asked with an exasperated sigh. 

“It was the forest again. But this time, I saw our farmhouse. It was destroyed,” Carlo described.

His father's eyes widened, staring blankly onto his coffee mug. 

“And when I woke up, something was trying to hurt me. Then it disappeared.”

“It was just another nightmare, Carlo. You're okay.”

“This house is haunted, Papa. People have also been disappearing. I'm scared.”

His father’s jaw tightened, before squeezing his eyes shut, “Just… do not leave this property, Carlo. Also, get properly dressed. Tita Thea will visit us this afternoon.

Upon finishing breakfast, Carlo found his way to the stables. This time, he chose to ride Snow as promised.

Snow galloped smoothly along the grass, his white mane flowing against the wind. 

However, after some time, Snow began to gallop faster, jumping over the fences. Carlo shrieked, calling for help and desperately trying to stop Snow by pulling his reins. 

Snow did not obey, neighing excitedly and running forward as the guards around the property were yelling from a distance.

Carlo panicked, knowing full well that he couldn't climb down Snow. After some time however, Snow's excitement ceased and he stopped in his tracks. The horse began to shiver. What stood before them was a dark, forested area. The putrid smell assaulted Carlo's senses.

Carlo pulled Snow's reins to the side, trying to make him swerve back, but the horse did not listen. Instead, Carlos gasped when Snow turned around on his own volition and began running back to the farmhouse. 

“Snow!” Carlo yelled, pulling the lead gently to make the horse stop. He felt his breathing beginning to calm when Snow slowed down, and they proceeded back home.

Upon entering the living room of the house, Carlo found Tita Thea sitting by the brown leather couch. She smiled, a hand pressed against her chest, seemingly relieved.

“Oh Carlo, you're safe!” she exclaimed, giving him a hug. She straightened her long pink skirt before sitting on the couch again. Next to her was his father, a stern expression on his face. 

“Carlo, you are no longer riding the horses. I have to send them back to my other property,” his father said.

“No, Papa! Please don’t!” 

“It's for your safety, Carlo,” Tita Thea tried to reason with him, but the boy was not able to accept this. 

He stormed out of the living room, and into his own bedroom. There, he fell onto his bed and began to cry. His vision went blurry with tears, as he lamented the idea of his friends being sent away.

A few moments later, however, he heard a knock on his door. Tita Thea slowly entered his room, and sat on his bed. She gently gave him a pat on the head. 

“You know, Carlo, there is something that I need to tell you,” Tita Thea said, “Hopefully, this will help you listen to your Papa.”

“Yes Tita?” Carlo asked, sniffling. He felt too angry to look at her.

“You see, back in the day, there were mythical creatures who would roam the area,” Tita Thea explained, “They would be fed with offerings.”

Carlo, bewildered, finally looked at his Tita. Her eyes were narrowed, and a look of guilt was evident in her face. “Then what happened to them?” he asked.

“Well, industrialization began, where buildings and houses began to rise and offerings no longer became a tradition,” Tita Thea replied. 

“Oh no Tita. Poor creatures,” Carlo lamented, “So they have nothing to eat?”

“They do,” she smiled and giggled, “Where do you think these disappearances are coming from? The locals around our area told me about this.”

Carlo sat down, frozen. Tita is just trying to scare me.

“This property, used to be a large portion of the forests, Carlo. It also had a lot of wild horses,” she said, “But, your great-grandfather built this house over it.”

“So… ” Carlo realized, his breathing growing heavy, “We stole the homes of the horses and the mythical creatures? They must be angry!”

“No, no, Carlo,” Tita Thea reassured him, “It is safe! See? The house is the reason why the mythical creatures are gone! The horses sinply ran away. So stay here, and do not go out, understand?”

Carlo nodded. Deep down, however, a part of him doubted his Tita's words. 

Later that night after Tita Thea had left, Carlo went to bed. He felt uneasy, but his exhaustion from the day made him drift off to sleep. Suddenly, shortly after a few moments of silence, a shrieking noise was heard. Carlo's eyes shot open, and before him, stood something he had never seen before. 

Tall and shadowy, with abnormally long and spindly arms, like that of a spider. Then, it vanished. 

Carlo gasped, his throat too dry to scream. Barely processing what he just saw, a shiver quickly went up his spine. What was that? 

There it was again, the unfamiliar and unbearable stench. It did not leave.

Carlo ran out of his room and to the stables. He didn't want to sleep. He could not return to his room.

In the darkness of the stables, the two horses stood there, looking at him. Night and Snow. The darkness obscured their faces, and he wasn't able to tell who was who. 

“We need to run from here!” Carlo cried. He released snow from the fences, and the white horse galloped away as quickly as possible.

Carlo mounted the one whom he believed was Night. However, upon settling down, he felt like he was sitting higher than usual. Unlike a rounded belly between his calves, it felt hard and bony. Carlos found it strange, but before he could try and climb down, it was too late.

Night galloped faster than usual, and made very odd grunting noises. They passed by trees and dark corners, the sky obscured by ashy clouds. 

“Night! Stop! Not there!” Carlo yelled, as his horse ran forward. It was getting very dark, and more trees surrounded the path. Carlo no longer knew where he was. It was so quiet. Then, he fell from the horse's back, exhausted. 

Upon waking up, his heart beat faster than usual, and his eyes landed on a bewildering sight. Carlos felt sick to the stomach, his breathing quickening as he backed away. 

Hanging, impaled against a tree branch, was Night, his beautiful black horse, now a mass of half-eaten and mangled pink flesh. The horse's limbs were twisted in odd angles, and its jaw was gone. Night, the once strong and beautiful horse, was now a barely recognizable corpse.

Carlo cried, and through his blurry vision, he noticed more in the darkness. Hanging limbs of people and other animals– legs, arms, heads, and more, hanging on branches above him. He even saw the heads of his father's security guards, one of their eyes missing, and the other one with his skull partially exposed.

Then, he heard a familiar grunting noise behind him. Carlo turned around, and there he was. Tree. 

The reddish-brown fur, the sunken eyes, the long and spider-like limbs, standing on two feet. Carlos sat there, frozen, as the creature stretched its long, spindly, human-like hands towards him.
